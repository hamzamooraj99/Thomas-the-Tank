## 📝 About the Game  
**Toy Tank Battle** is a **pure physics-based** tank combat game that blends **realistic mechanics with an ironically dramatic toy world**.  

✅ **Key Features:**  
- 🚗 **Fully Physics-Driven Gameplay** – Every movement, shot, and collision for the tanks is controlled by physics (no animations or rigid scripts).  
- 🧠 **Smart Enemy AI** – Enemies dynamically navigate terrain, predict shots, and engage in strategic combat.  
- 🎨 **Custom UI & HUD** – Impressive in-game UI using **TextMeshPro** with dynamic timers and health bars.  
- 🔊 **Advanced Sound Integration** – Background music, SFX, and real-time sound transitions enhance immersion.  
- 🛠️ **Dynamic Win/Loss System** – Custom victory/defeat screens with dedicated soundtracks.  

📌 *Built as a coursework project, focusing on deep AI logic, physics-based mechanics, and immersive UX.*

## 🏗 Outstanding Technical Features  

### 🛞 1. Fully Physics-Based Gameplay  
Unlike typical arcade-style tank games, *Thomas the Tank: The Game* relies entirely on **Unity's physics engine**:  
- **Tank movement uses real friction & acceleration with Unity's wheel colliders**, rather than instant direction changes.  
- **Shell projectiles follow realistic parabolic trajectories** with proper force calculations.  
- **Explosions cause real knockback**, affecting both player and enemies.  

💡 *This was a key challenge to balance for gameplay feel!*  

---

### 🧠 2. Advanced Enemy AI  
The **enemy tanks** use a custom AI system that:  
- **Navigates obstacles dynamically** using Unity’s **NavMesh and AI Navigation**.  
- **Changes its state** based on health and player positioning.
- **Retreats and looks for Health items** when on low health.
- **Enemy soldiers follow a tank** creating a swarm visual.

🔍 *AI tanks feel like real opponents, not just static targets!*  

---

### 🎮 3. Custom & Dynamic UI System  
- **Fully animated HUD** using **TextMeshPro** and **Unity UI components**, with real-time countdown timers and alerts.  
- **Responsive health bars & damage indicators** for better player feedback.  
- **Custom fonts, animations, and transitions** for a polished, professional look.
- **Camera following health bars above Enemy tanks** for more interactive gameplay.

🖥 *Every UI element was carefully designed to be both functional and immersive.*  

---

### 🔊 4. Advanced Sound Design & Integration  
- **Dramatic orchestral soundtrack** for battles.  
- **3D Spatial Sound Effects**: Explosions, gunfire, tank movement.  
- **Dynamic sound layering** – explosions, gunfire, and engine noises react to gameplay in real time.  
- **Custom victory & defeat tracks**, enhancing the emotional impact of wins/losses.  

🎧 *All sound effects were carefully integrated for maximum impact.*
